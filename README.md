# Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. The goal is to build a predictive model that determines passenger survival based on various features such as age, gender, socio-economic class, and other characteristics.

## Project Objective
Predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques, with a target accuracy of at least 78.9% on the Kaggle leaderboard.

## Methodology
### Feature Engineering
- Explored passenger data to uncover survival patterns
- Created intelligent features to improve model performance
- Conducted iterative analysis and model refinement

### Approach Highlights
1. Initial baseline: Predicting all passengers die
2. Basic logistic regression with initial feature engineering
3. Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Advanced feature creation and model optimization

## Performance
- **Minimum Target Accuracy:** 78.9%
- **Excellent Performance:** > 83% (top 2% on Kaggle)
- **Final Leaderboard Score:** [79.186]
